    

Is the any difference in the following ways to define array in perl?
Which is the preferred way? Thanks
    
    
    #A
    my @eles = (
        "abc",
        "bbc"
    );
    
    #B
    @eles = ("abc", "bbc");
    
    #C
    @eles = qw(abc, bbc);
    
    #D
    @eles = qw(
    abc
    bbc
    );
    
    #E
    @eles = qw{
    abc
    bbc
    };
    
    #F
    @eles = qw(abc bbc);
