Here is the solution to keep ownership, if anyone interested.

I modified the procedures, it passed the current basic tests. 

    # the original file information
    ok 1 - /shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz Found
    ok 2 - /shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz -- fileowner <504>
    ok 3 - /shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz -- inode <692254>

    # copy file to /tmp, processed by uid 500
    ***cp -vf /shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz /tmp
    `/shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz' -> `/tmp/colourbar.nii.gz'
    ***gunzip -f /tmp/colourbar.nii.gz
    ***gzip -f /tmp/colourbar.nii
    ok 4 - /tmp/colourbar.nii.gz -- fileowner <500>
    ok 5 - /tmp/colourbar.nii.gz -- inode <31>


    # copy back to overwrite, and the ownership preserved
    ***cp -vf /tmp/colourbar.nii.gz /shared/shared
    `/tmp/colourbar.nii.gz' -> `/shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz'
    ok 6 - /shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz -- fileowner <504>
    ok 7 - /shared/shared/colourbar.nii.gz -- inode <692254>
