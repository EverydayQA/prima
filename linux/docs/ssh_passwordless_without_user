passwordless ssh without user directory?

    .ssh should be stored in a user directory as far as I understood.
    
    ServerA: Linux without /home/users 
    ServerB: Linux with /home/users 
    client:  Linux/mac etc

    client passwordless ssh to SGE, no problem
    client psswordless ssh to ServerA, no problem
    SeverA passwordless ssh to ServerB, problem
    if there is no actual user directories in ServerA
    how public key for each user without user directory existing?
    or is there other ways to safely ssh to ServerB from ServerA?   


Thanks
