We are currently doing classic planA   
My question is which is better?  
both files exist, with size of 50-100M  
assume in the same NFS mount in Linux/mac  
assume this is a overwrite where both files exist  


    # planA - we do this way
    mv /pathA/fileA /pathB/fileB

    # planB 
    rm /pathB/fileB; mv /pathA/fileB /pathB/fileB
    
    # planB1 - I think is the same as planB, but not sure
    unlink /pathB/fileB; ln /pathA/fileA /pathB/fileB
