Exit codes are logged separated by comma

The last 2 fields are exit code of 2 versions

    /opt/a/b/c,parameter,a b c,3,1
    /opt/a/d/e,parameter,a b c,1,1
    /opt/a/b/d,parameter,0,0
    /opt/a/e/c,parameter,0,1

The exit code range from 0 to 20
How do I extract lines with different exit codes?

I am tired of doing:

    
    
    cat log|grep -v ,0,0|grpe -v ,1,1|grep -v ,2,2

Thanks
