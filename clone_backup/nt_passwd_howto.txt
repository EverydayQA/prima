# final goal - fix sluggish win7 laptop and clone image/disk to SSD
# recover a win7 administrator passwd

This procedure is mainly for myself, in case I have to do it again

reboot to safeMode did not work
it is extremely slow to mess around in windows
not familiar with windows in general
cannot prepare for cloning with admin passwd
no repair disk

step 1: a linux machine(fedora 24 ready)
step 2: fedora24 have ntfs supported
step 3: fedora24 have chntpasswd installed by dnf
step 4: usb dock ready
step 5: take out SDD from lenovo machine
step 6: insert into usb dock connected to fedora24
step 7: fedora24 make sure the SSD is mounted
    mount -t ntfs /dev/sdd3 /media/leveno_sdd
    find . -name SAM
    cd sth/System32/config/
    chntpasswd 
    details will be filled later
