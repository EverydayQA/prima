clone current sdd with win7 to SSD
date: 2016-10-xx
source: SDD 1000G 2.5 inch in lenovo ideapad y510d with about 600G usage
target: ssd 500G PNY 2.5inch sata 480G CS1311

# choose a cloning tool for a first timer
PNY ssd came with a acronis true image 1 pc license which you have to be careful which machine to install
clonzilla fans really recommend this one
Plan A: acronis clone 2014
    manufacturer bundled sofeware, must be the first choice
    seems to be very straight forward
    nice interface, less intimidate

Plan B: clonezilla 2.4.7 i686
    free, can be used on any machine
    familiar with linux more than windows myself
    
summary:
    I should not use acronis clone inside win7, it has to be boot from DVD
    I tried once to clone inside win7 and boot from acronis bootable disk, and ended up clone a win7 starting with Acronis clone
    it ended up with a good clone partition to SSD
    
    clonezilla throws some warnings, actually does not matter
    it ended up with a good clone too
    future usage - both tools are fine, really depends on situations
details will be attached later on
